### Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware is experiencing rapid growth in recent years, AtliQ has recognized the pivotal role of data analytics in gaining a competitive edge in the market. The company has embarked on a transformative journey by deciding to implement Power BI for comprehensive data analysis, marking their first exploration harnessing the power of business intelligence tools. The primary goal of this initiative is to enable data-driven decision-making across various facets of the organization, including finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain.

### Companyâ€™s background

AtliQ is a company that sells hardware and gadgets to different stores like Croma, Best Buy, Staples, and online platforms such as Flipkart. These stores then sell the products to regular people (end consumer).

After making the products, AtliQ stores them in a warehouse before sending them out to the stores. AtliQ has two platforms to sell its products: through physical stores (like Croma and Best Buy) and online (on Amazon and Flipkart). Also, AtliQ uses three different channels to sell its products: through retailers, directly to customers, and through distributors. This helps AtliQ reach more people and adapt to different ways of selling.
